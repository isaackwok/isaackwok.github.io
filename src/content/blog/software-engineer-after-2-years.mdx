Time flies, I've become a Software Engineer for 2 years.

At the very beginning of my career, I always think about **"How to become a better engineer"**.I spent most of my time keep learning new web frameworks and technologies.

However, as you can tell, new things keep coming up in the software world, we have infinite things to learn day by day. So having this mindset is kind of "infinite loop", you can never stop. And it makes me seriously anxious.

I love creating stuff, and that's why I love programming, I can develop applications that help improve my life. However, I realise that all I have is just "programming".

Thus, I started to explore and developing new hobbies, I try to treat developing software as "just a work" now (I still love it). I spend more time on photographing, traveling, and the most important thing -- **get along with myself**.

For now, my most important thought is -- _You only live once, enjoy your life and know yourself._
