## Environment

- Package manager: pnpm. Node >= 22 required (`.nvmrc`: 24.14.1) — the shell may default to Node 20, which breaks pnpm 11 with a `node:sqlite` error. Run `nvm use` (or prepend `$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v24.14.1/bin` to PATH) before pnpm commands.
- Tailwind v4: no `tailwind.config.js`; design tokens are defined via `@theme` in `src/styles/global.css`.

## Design system

- Japanese minimalism: plain white background, warm ink text, no borders or divider rules — spacing does the structural work.
- Color tokens (in `global.css`): `kami` white, `sumi` ink, `hai` secondary gray, `hinata` sunlight-gold links, `komorebi` pale glow (selection). Fonts: Shippori Mincho (display), Zen Kaku Gothic New (body), loaded from Google Fonts in `Layout.astro`.
- Sections use `Section.astro` with vertical kanji margin markers (`kanji` + `label` props).
- Compound components: folders like `src/components/WorkExperience/` hold `List.astro` + `Row.astro` re-exported from `index.ts`, used as `<WorkExperience.List>` via `import * as WorkExperience` dot notation.

## Layout & pages

- `Layout.astro` owns the entire `<head>`: canonical URL, Open Graph/Twitter meta (including the `public/og.png` social card), JSON-LD Person schema, fonts. Pages pass `title` / `description` props — never add meta tags in a page.
- Every page renders inside `PageShell.astro` (wraps `Layout` and provides the centered `<main>` column, `Nav`, and the © footer with a build-time year) with a `PageHeader.astro` on top for subpages. Don't hand-roll the main/nav/footer frame in a page.
- Page navigation fades via Astro's `<ClientRouter />`: old page out (0.3s), blank kami hold (0.15s), new page in (0.3s). Timing config in `Layout.astro`, keyframes in `global.css`.
- `/articles` is an intentional stub rendered with `Placeholder.astro`.
- `/music` is an album grid with preview playback. Album data lives in `src/data/music.yaml`; a content-collection loader resolves artwork + ~30–90s preview MP3s from the iTunes Lookup API at build time (no keys; visitors never call Apple). The mini-player in `Layout.astro` is `transition:persist`ed so audio survives page navigation. Add an album: append artist/title/`itunesId`/`country`/`spotifyUrl` to `music.yaml` (find the `itunesId` via `https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=<album>&entity=album&country=<storefront>`); restart the dev server to see it — the loader only runs at startup.
- `/gallery` is a curated photo flow driven by a content collection. Add a photo: drop a JPEG (pre-resized to ~2000px longest edge) into `src/assets/gallery/` and add three lines to `src/data/gallery.yaml` (`image`, `alt`, `caption`); top-to-bottom order is display order.

## Development

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Testing

- `pnpm test` runs the Vitest unit tests (`pnpm test:watch` for watch mode). Tests are colocated: `src/lib/*.test.ts` cover the iTunes lookup and gallery parsing; `src/data/data.test.ts` sanity-checks `gallery.yaml` (images exist, alt/caption present) and `music.yaml` (valid ids, storefronts, Spotify URLs).
- The gallery loader's parser lives in `src/lib/gallery.ts` (`parseGallery`) so it stays unit-testable — don't inline it back into `content.config.ts`.

## Deployment

- Every push to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (withastro/action, Node 24) — no manual build step.
- Custom domain `isaackwok.com` lives in two places that must stay in sync: `public/CNAME` and `site` in `astro.config.mjs`. Canonical URLs and the sitemap both derive from `site`.
